## 1- What is a 2-Way Set Associative Cache?
A set-associative cache allows each memory block to map to a specific set containing multiple lines (ways).

In 2-way set associative, each set contains 2 lines. The cache index selects a set, but within that set, two tags are compared in parallel. Replacement policy (e.g., LRU) decides which line to evict when the set is full
## 2- Specifications of Our 2-Way Set Associative Cache:



| **Parameter**        | **Value (from code)** |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Word Size            | 32 bits (per word) |
| Words per Block      | 4 words |
| Block Size           | 128 bits (16 bytes per block) |
| Number of Blocks     | 64 (total cache lines across all sets & ways) |
| Associativity        | 2-way (each set holds 2 cache lines) |
| Number of Sets       | 32 sets (NUM_BLOCKS / NUM_WAYS) |
| Cache Size           | 1 KB (64 blocks Ã— 16 bytes = 1024 bytes) |
| Index Bits           | 5 ($clog2(NUM_SETS) = 32 â†’ 5) |
| Block Offset Bits    | 2 ($clog2(WORDS_PER_BLOCK) = 4 â†’ 2) |
| Tag Width            | 25 bits |
| Valid Bit            | 1 per cache line |

| Replacement Policy   | PLRU (Pseudo-LRU), maintained as a single bit per set |
| Cache Line Format    | {valid (1), dirty (1), tag (25), block (128 bits)} â†’ total 155 bits per cache line |
| Data Storage         | 2D array: `cache[NUM_SETS][2]` (set-indexed, 2 ways per set) |

## 3- Top-Level Diagram (2-Way vs Direct-Mapped):
 Top level diagram almost remains the same, here is the brief overview:
### ***Inputs***:
- **req_type**: 0 = Read, 1 = Write (same as direct-mapped).

- **req_valid**: Indicates CPU request (same).

- **address [31:0]**: Physical address from CPU. (Difference: address now splits into Tag=25 bits, Index=5 bits, Offset=2 bits).

- **data_in [31:0]**: Data from CPU for write requests(same).

- **data_out_mem [127:0]**: 128-bit block from main memory (same).

- **clk, rst**: System clock and reset. 

### ***Outputs***

- **data_out [31:0]**: Word returned to CPU.(same)

- **done_cache:** Request completed.(same)

- **dirty_block_out [127:0]**: Block sent to memory on eviction.(same)

- **hit:** Indicates tag match in either way (different from direct-mapped where only 1 tag check existed).

## **4- Datapath (2-Way Overview)**:
### ***Similarities***:

- CPU sends requests (req_valid, req_type, address, data_in).

- Cache Decoder still splits address into {Tag, Index, Block Offset}.

- Cache Controller FSM still handles Compare â†’ WriteBack â†’ WriteAllocate â†’ RefillDone states.

- Main memory interface unchanged: 128-bit transfers.

### ***Key Differences***:
1- **Tag Comparison:**

Direct-Mapped â†’ 1 tag check per set.

2-Way â†’ two parallel comparators, one for each way.

2- **Cache Storage:**

Direct-Mapped â†’ cache[NUM_SETS] (one line per set).

2-Way â†’ cache[NUM_SETS][2] (two lines per set).

3- **Replacement Policy:**

Direct-Mapped â†’ No replacement needed (fixed slot).

2-Way â†’ Pseudo-LRU (1 bit per set) decides which way to evict.

4- **Hit Signal:**

Direct-Mapped â†’ hit = valid && (tag == stored_tag).

2-Way â†’ hit = (hit_way0 || hit_way1).

## **5- Cache Controller (FSM Brief)**:
The FSM remains almost identical:

- **IDLE** â†’ wait for req_valid.

- **COMPARE** â†’

   If hit â†’ serve read/write.

   If miss + clean â†’ fetch from memory.

  If miss + dirty â†’ write-back old block.

- **WRITE_BAC**K â†’ send dirty block to memory.

- **WRITE_ALLOCATE** â†’ request new block from memory.

- **REFILL_DONE** â†’ write block into cache, update PLRU, return to CPU.

## **Module-by-Module Explanation**:
### 1-  ***cache_decoder***:
 #### **Inputs:**

- clk, address [31:0]
#### **Outputs:**

- tag [24:0]

- index [4:0]

- blk_offset [1:0]
#### **Function:**
Splits the 32-bit CPU address into:

- tag (upper bits): sent to both way (contains 2 lines â†’ way0 and way1).comparators.

- index (middle bits): selects the set (contains 5 bits to represent 32 sets)

- block offset (lowest bits): selects word within block.

### 2- Cache controller:
Cache controler module is exactly same as direct mapped cache.

### 3- Main Memory Interface:
main memory interface is also exactly the same as direct mapped cache.

### 4- Cache Memory module:
####  ***Inputs***:

- **clk** â€“ system clock  
- **tag [TAG_WIDTH-1:0]** â€“ extracted tag from CPU address  
- **index [INDEX_WIDTH-1:0]** â€“ selects cache set  
- **blk_offset [OFFSET_WIDTH-1:0]** â€“ selects word within block  
- **req_type** â€“ 0 = Read, 1 = Write  
- **read_en_cache** â€“ enables cache read (CPU-side)  
- **write_en_cache** â€“ enables cache write (CPU-side)  
- **read_en_mem** â€“ enables memory read (refill)  
- **write_en_mem** â€“ enables memory write (eviction)  
- **data_in_mem [BLOCK_SIZE-1:0]** â€“ new block from memory  
- **data_in [WORD_SIZE-1:0]** â€“ single word from CPU  
- **refill** â€“ indicates block replacement/refill operation

#### **Outputs**

- **dirty_block_out [BLOCK_SIZE-1:0]** â€“ evicted dirty block (to memory)  
- **hit** â€“ asserted if tag match in any way  
- **data_out [WORD_SIZE-1:0]** â€“ word returned to CPU on read hit  
- **dirty_bit** â€“ indicates dirty block present in current set  

#### **Internal Structures**

- **Cache Line Format** â€“ `{valid, dirty, tag, block_data}`  
- **cache array** â€“ `cache[NUM_SETS][2]` â†’ 2 ways per set  
- **PLRU array** â€“ `plru[NUM_SETS]` â†’ 1-bit replacement info per set  
- **cache_info_t struct (info0, info1)** â€“ Holds per-way signals: valid, dirty, tag, block, hit .
#### ***Functionality***:
##### i- **Hit/Miss Detection**

For each set, the two ways are checked in parallel:

- If the stored tag matches the CPU tag and valid bit = 1, that way asserts a hit.

- If neither way hits, a miss occurs and replacement must be performed. 

 ##### ii- **Replacement Policy â€“ PLRU**

This design uses **Pseudo-LRU (PLRU)** instead of a true LRU to reduce hardware cost.

##### ***How PLRU Works in This Module***:
- Each set has a single **PLRU bit** (`plru[index]`)  
- This bit points to the victim candidate for the next replacement  
- **If `plru[index] = 0` â†’ way-0** will be replaced on a miss  
- **If `plru[index] = 1` â†’ way-1** will be replaced on a miss  
- Whenever a way is accessed (hit or refill), the PLRU bit **flips** to mark the other way as the future victim  

This ensures that the way least recently accessed is always chosen, but with only **1 bit per set** overhead.

##### ***Example Flow***:
1. CPU hits in **way-0** â†’ `plru[index]` is set to `1` (so way-1 is next victim)  
2. Next miss in that set â†’ **way-1** will be evicted  
3. If CPU then hits in **way-1** â†’ `plru[index]` flips back to `0`  

Thus, PLRU approximates LRU but with far less storage.

##### iii-  **Miss Handling**

When a miss occurs:
- If **one way is invalid** â†’ the block is refilled into that empty way  
- If **both are valid** â†’ the PLRU victim way is chosen  
- If the victim is **clean** â†’ directly overwritten  
- If the victim is **dirty** â†’ the dirty block is written to memory first (`dirty_block_out`), then refilled with new data  



#### iv- **Read and Write Operations**

- **On a Read Hit**  
  - The requested word (`blk_offset`) is selected from the block and sent to `data_out`  
  - PLRU is updated to point to the other way  

- **On a Write Hit**  
  - The word is updated in place and marked **dirty**  
  - PLRU flips to mark the other way as next victim  

- **On a Miss**  
  - Memory is accessed, block is refilled, and PLRU is updated accordingly  

---

#### ***Why PLRU is Efficient Here***
- **Low cost** â†’ Just one bit per set vs. full history bits in true LRU  
- **Good approximation** â†’ Ensures alternate ways are reused fairly  
- **Hardware friendly** â†’ Implemented as simple flip logic in always blocks  

âœ… This makes **PLRU** the ideal replacement policy for small, low-complexity 2-way associative caches like this one.

## Testbench Documentation for `cache_memory`

### Purpose
The testbench (`cache_tb`) is designed to verify and validate the functionality of the `cache_memory` module.  
It systematically simulates read and write operations across multiple ways of a set-associative cache, verifying:

- Cache hit/miss detection  
- Dirty bit handling (clean vs. dirty evictions)  
- PLRU replacement policy operation during block eviction  
- Correct refill from memory on misses
